xdg-rs
====

xdg-rs is a utility library to make conforming to the [XDG specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) easier

Some code borrowed from [rust-xdg](https://github.com/o11c/rust-xdg). ```rust-xdg``` is
currently a more complete implementation of the specification. The APIs provided by
```rust-xdg``` and ```xdg-rs``` are different.
